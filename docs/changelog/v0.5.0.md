# v0.5.0a - ~The Data Modeling Edition~
(changelog_v050)=

A lot. Namely a whole rewriting of the {mod}`autopilot.data` module.

Jonny is working on finishing their dissertation and is really running up against time for writing docs
and so needs to leave the changelog blank for now.

One thing to be aware of is that the subject class will attempt to update any of your existing
.h5 files to the new format -- it should be nondestructive (making a backup of the whole file first
and then making backups up any tables that it can't create a new version of that fully preserves
the data from the previous version), but don't be alarmed when your subject files start updating!
It might be a good idea to make a full backup of your data directory before making this update
(but that's something we recommend anyway).
