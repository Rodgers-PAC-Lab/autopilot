        Note that this __init__ does not call the superclass __init__, 
        because that superclass Task inclues functions for punish_block
        and so on that we don't want to use.
        
        Some params, such as `step_name` and `task_type`, are always required 
        to be specified in the json defining this protocol
        
        Other params, such as `reward`, are custom to this particular task.
        They should be described in the class attribute `PARAMS` above, and
        their values should be specified in the protocol json.

        subject : string
            The name of the subject
        step : 0
            Index into the "protocol" json?
        session : int
            number of times it's been started
        pilot : string
            The name of this pilot
        graduation : dict
            Probably a dict of graduation criteria
        reward (int):
